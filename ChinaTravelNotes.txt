   Food:
   
         宫保鸡丁 GONG BAO JI DING -- J顺丰123 SHUN FENG 123. There’s a few in the city. It’s “luxury” affordable home style cq Chinese.

    I don’t know what Sichuan style wonton is exactly but I’d guess you mean CHAO SHOU. 
    There’s ships that sell chaoshou and #4 xiaomian together. You can also get chaoshou xiaomian at some places.
    Hotpot for one, go to a place called 小天鹅 XIAO TIAN E. Its single serve hotpot’s usually located in malls. The logo is a goose.
    Literally anywhere and everywhere. Just look for the Chinese characters 小面 XIAOMIAN. Also, this is sorta a breakfast food but also not completely so you won’t find a lot of these shops just selling this.
    Hula Mian Restaurant, which is 呼啦面馆

                鹅岭公园 for one of the best views in central Chongqing       
       
       Shopping
       Hongya Caves/Hongyadong      洪崖洞    (a fantasy recreation of old Chongqing on a steep slope next to the river. It's fake but somehow still unique. Like a vertical version of the classic old street. It looks better from the outside than from within. | I wouldn't recommend it.)
       Huangjueya                   黄桷垭老街  (Sipping tea, buy souvenir, Not particularly unique but laid back. | I recommend it but not strongly)
       Zhazidong                    渣滓洞         (detention center WWII)
       Three Gorges Dam
       
       Three gorges museum, located in the center of the city, it's got some artifacts that were dug up in recent decades, a (dry) miniature of the three gorges dam and some folklore traditional clothing. | I wouldn't recommend it unless you really love museums

       Eat eel hotpot. 
       Get out of urban Chongqing and visit the Wulong Karst, Dazu Rock Carvings, the Ghost City, White Emperor City.     

 What I'd visit: huguang guild hall 湖广会馆 (well-preserved guildhall for Qing-era merchants from other provinces), 
 walk from there to the liberation monument, from there to 山城步道 near jiaochangkou subway station (a narrow series of staircases passing through restored old neighbourhoods 
 and along cliffs with views across the yangtze), end at qixinggang subway station. 
 There's cool places to wander down side-alleys near there, can follow them all the way down to the area near the 3 gorges museum/Chongqing municipal centre. 
 Then I'd head to Eling park 鹅岭公园 for one of the best views in central Chongqing, if you're a WWII buff there are museums below this area about the Flying Tigers and US General Stillwell's former residence.

Another good day trip would be head across from downtown yuzhong district to the area around shangxinjie station, 
there are some renovated historic districts along the water front there (龙门浩 and 弹子石 further downriver) 
but the most impressive thing is to climb nanshan and check out some of the views across the city (if the weather agrees). 
There are several routes, some on steps while you can freestyle through dirt paths if you want, and some cool things nestled among the various peaks 
(definitely check out 老君洞 laojun cave, a multi-level temple with several shrines dug into the caves behind it). 
I forget the path there but Germany's wartime embassy is hidden on one of the peaks, and there are a bunch of Christian rock carvings along the trail behind it. 
You can also keep going to the wartime mansions of Chiang Kaishek and other KMT officials which have been turned into museums. 
The Chongqing botanical gardens are also worth a stroll if you're not tired out.

Other places worth checking out: the art district called huangjueping 黄桷坪 near the old Sichuan Fine Arts Campus, 
hot springs in Beibei district are great for relaxing though quite far from the centre and a bit pricy but make a great reward after doing some hikes nearby. 
The trendiest dining/cafe/bar area is near huangnibang station on and around ziwei road. 
Main expat bar is Shots near Ikea, good hangout pub is the Lost Boys, best music venues are Nuts for bands and Echo Bay for techno/electronic stuff.


Other:
    Food:
       Chongqing beef noodles are delicious (as are most varieties of Xiaomian). Barbecue is great. 
       hot pot or chuan chuan or whatever. I highly reccomend drinking peanut milk during and or getting at least one yogurt drink after. This will reduce the not fun parts of hotpot the next day.



I stayed in Ascott Raffles City, which is right above the last stop of a subway line, and also above a big shopping center. Would recommend it as it's decently cheap for the location 
and size of the room. It's a serviced apartment as opposed to a hotel, which really just means that I was staying in an apartment as opposed to a hotel room. My "room" was 600+ square feet 
and had a washer, and was only $120 a night or so.
The first night that I was there I walked to Hongyadong and walked on the road along the river. That was a mistake. Whatever walkway/sidewalk they have (on either side of the street) 
is not built for the number of people that go there. It was extremely crowded and slow moving, as you also have tons of photoshoots happening there. There are lots of people there for hire 
as photographers, along with shops that'll dress you up in traditional clothing for the photoshoot. Maybe worth it if you really want a photo of Hongyadong from the ground angle, but I tried 
to get out of there as soon as I can. Speaking of the photoshoots, I thought it was genius that the people trying to get you to buy the photoshoots were walking around with tablets showing 
photos that they've shot. This only happened in Chongqing and I thought was very smart. A better spot for seeing Hongyadong (in my opinion) is actually from 1. the riverbank opposite 
Hongyadong, where you also get a cool bridge that lights up, and 2. on that bridge itself. You can get to the riverbank by taking the subway to the Chongqing Grand Theater and then walking 
down to the riverbank. There were definitely a lot of people, but because it's so big you never felt crowded. Afterwards, you can walk onto the aforementioned bridge (located right by the 
subway station) and then walk across to the side that Hongyadong is on. On the bridge there are vendors selling food, drinks, and little trinkets. The view/photo that you can get from the 
bridge (once you get close to the Hongyadong side) was great. Eling Park was worth it. Free to enter, some nice trees and whatnot, and had a little tower that you can climb for a sweet view 
of Chongqing from high up. Note that you need a Chinese ID to get into the turnstyle for this tower (I guess it was put in during COVID), but I just asked the security guard there and he 
scanned me in. Liziba station (the station where the train goes into the building) was fine. I went because it was a 20 minute walk from Eling park. Cool concept I guess but lots of 
people there. A better spot I found for train photos was actually this place called "Train to Spring". It's basically a train that runs through a park called Fotugang Park, but during 
the Spring there are really pretty pink trees alongside. This link has all of the information. The park itself was also very pretty, and there was almost no one there! 
When I went the trees were no longer pink but a nice dark red, which was still very pretty. Do note that to see the train you have to walk down a bunch of steps, so if you plan on returning 
to the same station you'll have to walk back up those steps. I ended up walking down all the way as there was a different train station about 10 minutes from the bottom of the park.
Did the Chongqing Zoo to see pandas, and had success. But the day I went it was also super hot and I didn't get there until after 11 AM, so a lot of the animals did not show. Would recommend 
going earlier in the morning, or when it's cool out.

Speaking of heat, the Chongqing heat is no joke. It's extremely humid in Chongqing so be prepared to sweat through your clothes.
Shibati was pretty cool, gives like an ancient town vibe while having shops like Tim Hortons and KFC there. Regardless, it's very pretty when lit up at night, and there are lots of shops to by souvenirs there. Would recommend as it's pretty easy to get to.

Last day I was in Chongqing I checked out Jiefangbei (nothing special but there is historic significance to it), and then walked over to Kuixing Building which is the building where it appears that you're on the ground floor but in reality you're on the 18th floor of a building. Overall solid and kind of cool to see.

For map, either use Gaode or Baidu. They have better navigation. 



For the metro, use the Transport function on Alipay. It'll provide a QR code that you can scan at the turnstyle. This saves you from having to buy a transit card. This worked in Shanghai and Chongqing, and I think works in most major cities in China. Also one thing to note for the metro in China is that there is a bag scanner at every entrance, so be prepared for that if you're carrying a bag.

Didi and Taxis are very cheap in China (compared to the U.S.)

    How to Rebuild Launchpad Database in OS X Yosemite (10.10) and Later

    1. Go to Library folder, which is hidden. To access it, click anywhere on desktop and make sure you see word 'Finder' in the top menu near Apple logo.
    2. Press and hold alt/option key and in the top menu bar select Go and finally Library.
    3. In the Library folder, locate and open the Application Support folder.
    4. In the Application Support folder, locate and open the Dock folder.
    5. You'll find a number of files in the Dock folder, including one named desktoppicture.db, and one or more files starting with a dashed set of capital letters and numbers and ending in .db. An example file name is FE0131A-54E1-2A8E-B0A0A77CFCA4.db. Grab all the files in the Dock folder with the dashed set of letters and numbers that end in .db and drag them to the trash or press ?/command + delete keys.
    6. Launch Terminal, located in the /Applications/Utilities folder.
    7. In the Terminal window, enter the following:

    "defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock"

    Launchpad has now been reset. The next time you open Launchpad, the app will rebuild the databases it needs. Launchpad may take a bit longer than usual to launch the first time, and the Launchpad display will now be in its default organization, with Apple apps shown first, and third-party apps next.

Q: Reinstalling OSX
A:
   NOTE: MAKE sure to turn on Wifi Network!!
   
   Shutdown
   Cmd-R - Power Button -- Can let go the Cmd-R once sees apple logo
   
   Cmd-R-Power Button -- Reinstall the latest macOS that was installed on your mac
   Option-R           -- Upgrade to the latest macOS
   Shift-Option-R     -- Reinstall macOS that came with your Mac
   
   // Wipe Disk
   Select Partition->Erase....(If grayed out, means didn't do it from recovery....Cmd-R-Power Button to reboot)
   
   Reinstall macOS
      
	  

	// Need to do this to bypass MDM
	See https://gist.github.com/henrik242/65d26a7deca30bdb9828e183809690bd
	
	I solved it.
	What I did: 
		1) I wiped the Macintosh HD, deleted Macintosh HD - Data (for sure). 
		2) Reinstalled Catalina WITH Internet - 
		    // Enable Internet
			i) just start "Reinstall macOS" in the list of Recovery Mode. Just do the steps. First, it downloads Catalina (i guess it downloads, cause it needs internet for that as it mentions), 
			
			// Disable Internet
			ii) Mac restarts and starts with Apple icon and shows the remaining time. It's the b) and c) steps of this title. 
					(B) normal download & update, block internet
					(C) update from USB stick, block internet			
			iii) You must be ready to run Recovery Mode(Cmd-R) right after it restarts second time. Did you get it? So:
	
		1) you see Catalina's Icon with bar and remaining time,
		2) then Apple's icon with remaining time,
		3) and when it's restarting after Apple's icon with remaining time, you hold Command + R keys to run Recovery Mode.
		4) Perform Disable Management steps below
	  
   Disable Remote Management:
	See https://gist.github.com/henrik242/65d26a7deca30bdb9828e183809690bd
	
		1) Go to recovery mode.  Cmd-R during reboot
	
		2) Open Utilities → Terminal and type

				$ csrutil disable
				$ reboot

		Hold command-R during the reboot to enter Recovery Mode again
		
		

		Enter Disk Utility, and mount the Macintosh HD volume (or whatever your main volume is named). (It might already be mounted.)

		Exit Disk Utility, open Utilities → Terminal, and type

			$ cd "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/System/Library"
			$ mkdir LaunchDaemons.disabled LaunchAgents.disabled
			$ mv LaunchDaemons/com.apple.ManagedClient* LaunchDaemons.disabled/
			$ mv LaunchAgents/com.apple.ManagedClient* LaunchAgents.disabled/
			$ cd ../../etc
			$ echo "0.0.0.0 albert.apple.com" >> hosts
			$ echo "0.0.0.0 iprofiles.apple.com" >> hosts
			$ echo "0.0.0.0 mdmenrollment.apple.com" >> hosts
			$ echo "0.0.0.0 deviceenrollment.apple.com" >> hosts
			$ echo "0.0.0.0 gdmf.apple.com" >> hosts
			$ csrutil enable
			$ reboot

			If you come to the “Choose your country/location” dialogue, make sure to not select a wireless network, but “continue without an internet connection”

			After a normal boot, you can verify the DEP status in Terminal:

		$ profiles status -type enrollment
		Enrolled via DEP: No
		MDM enrollment: No
		
Q: Create root folder in Catalina
A:
   Can no longer create root subdirectory. Need to use firm link
   "mkdir /User/jkuei/vagrant"
   "sudo vi /etc/synthetic.conf"
	vagrant<tab>Users/jkuei/vagrant			// MUST use tab not space
   "chmod 644 /etc/synthetic.conf"
   "sudo reboot"
   
   Can now use "ls /vagrant"

How to install Air Filter
	How to Install:

	Tools: Phillips head screwdriver, Common sense.
	Time: 10-15 min (more if this is you're first time, less if you know what you're doing)

	1) Turn off the engine and pop your hood.
	2) Remove the battery cover. (it's the cover right behind the driver's side headlight. There is a little locking mechanism that you must turn before gently pulling the cover off. If you don't the plastic piece will break. It's no big deal if you do though.
	3) Disconnect the battery. If you don't, just be careful not to touch the terminals.
	4) The airfilter assembly is the big black rectangular box with the hose coming out of it right behind the battery. There are four screws attached at the corners of this box. Unscrew these. They are tight, so make sure your screw driver is the right size and be firm. You don't have to remove these screws. You can but they kind of just stay on the cover after you unscrew. Just becareful when removing the lid not to lose the screws.
	5) With the screws undone you can lift the lid and see the filter inside. Take note of the color and placement of the filter. White should be on top. Blue on bottom. The angled edge pointing towards and out to the driver's side.
	6) The lid is tricky to pull off because the space is tight. Gently grab the edges of the old filter and lift the right side of the lid with filter inside the top lid. This will give you enough room to lift the lid enough, to drop the filter down and pull it out. If you try to lift the lid with the filter still in the bottom of the airfilter assembly, and then try to pull the filter out from the bottom it will get stuck.
	7) Make sure you don't have any leaves in there and grab the new filter. Slide it in and lift it up onto the lid and then place the lid down. Make sure all the edges are in and sealed.
	8) Screw it back on. Replace your battery cover.
	9) Remove your screwdriver and your head from underneath the hood, and close.
	10) Pat yourself on the back and grab a beer.

How to install Brake fluid (need 1 qt or 32 oz  1qt=32oz)
	NOTE: The bleed valve uses an 11 mm hex wrench on the Type-S model (4-piston caliper type).
		The end of the tube is dipped in the fluid so that if accidentally you release the brake pedal without closing the bleed screw it will suck the fluid and not the air! 
		The manual states front outer then inner for each Brembos calipers.  Brembo has 2 bleeders per caliper.
		When bleeding, put the collection bottle higher than the bleeder valve.  When done, move bleeder bottle below the valve, then disconnect.

	Step 1: Put tube on bleeder with hose running into bottom of the bottle on the ground.
	Step 2: Open bleeder, pump brakes until reservoir is empty (but before it sucks air into the lines).
	Step 3: Ensure that enough fluid has run into the bottle to submerge the tube outlet.
	Step 4: (bleeder valve is still open here...) Clean out the reservoir a bit with a clean, lint-free diaper or cloth. Fill with new fluid.
	Step 5: Pump the pedal (yes, keep bleeder valve open the entire time) 5-6 times to run the old fluid out of the lines. After so many pumps you will purge the lines of the old fluid and replace it with new.
	Step 6: Close the bleeder, remove the hose, and move to the next caliper. Refill the reservoir.
	Repeat Steps 3-6 for all 4 corners.


Q: Alignment, suspension
A: Camber -- measurement of center vertical line of wheel to road.
             positive camber, top of wheel slant to top left.  so tires looks like backward slash.  \
             negative camber, top of wheel slant from top right, to bottom left.  /

             Road going car want a slight of negative camber to improve road handling.  
             Racing will use postivie camber mainly for embankment

   Caster -- Measure how far forward of behind the steering axis to a vertical line.
             positive caster, steering axis to wheel.  /
             negative caster, steering axis behind the wheel.  \
       
             Positive caster the steering axis is in front of the vehicle.  Positive caster creates a lot of align torque which improves straight line drivability.
             Negative caster the steering axis is behind the vehicle.
             Caster must be symmetrical, can't have positive caster on one side and negative caster on another.  Car will pull to the side with less caster.

   Toe --    When view from bird's eye view, are wheel pointing inward or outward.  Like people's feet when walking
             Toe out -- Leading part of tire is pointing outward. (left tire)  \ -- / (right tire).  Improves "turn in" response, but cost tire wear.  Will make care oversteer.  
             Toe in --- Leading part of tire in pointing inward.    / --- \      Improve straight line stability of car especially at high speed.

      The Throttle is "Drive By Wire" and adapts to your particular driving
    style. Do a TBA Throttle body adaptation.

    1. Get in your car, it doesn't matter if you close the door or not.

    2. Turn the key to the on (not start) position, the position just before the starter
    turns over.

    3. Press the gas pedal to the floor with the key in the "on" position.

    4. Hold the pedal to the floor for five seconds, then turn the key back
    to the "off" position (don't remove the key), then release the gas
    pedal.

    5. Wait 2 mins. for a full alignment.

    6. Drive the car as you always do.

    Depending on your driving style, this may or may not be a big factor. I do a lot of city driving so
    I noticed a big change after erasing my history. It is not hard to do this, just follow the instructions -

    Key on, pedal down, 5 sec, key off pedal up, wait 2
    minutes.

    Keep the key in for the entire thing.

Q:  Tires
A:  See http://acurazine.com/forums/tires-wheels-suspension-130/tire-selection-wheel-size-master-guide-656174/
    215/50-17
    Wheels: 17x7, +55mm offset, 5x114.3mm (5x4.5") bolt pattern, 64.1mm centerbore
    Wheel bolt torque (just some bonus info ): 11 kg-m or 79.6 lb-ft (although I'm sure 80 lb-ft should be ok )
    Members have been able to mount anything from 16" up to 20" on the TSX. So long as the outside diameter of the tire doesn't change, you will be fine 
    with any size in that range. Wheel widths can range from 6.5" for winter tires up to 8" for summer. Some people have fitted larger wheel widths but 
    selecting a tire and offset that fits is difficult. I'll let other members post the particulars of their setup if it they have a solution that works.

			Lines, Rays, & Segments



Collinear: multiple points on the same stright line
Line Symbol : <----->
		PQ
Lines:  go on forever <---------->
	named after any two points on the line

Line segment symbol -----
                      PQ
Line segment: lines but they have endpoints .--------.
	       named after the two end points

Rays symbol   ---->
              PQ
Rays: line but with one endpoint while the other goes on forever .----->
      Named after end point and other point on the ray


			Angles and Degrees



Measure of an angle: how much you need to rotate one of the rays so it lies on top of the other ray

angles are measured in units called degrees



			Right, Acute, and Obtuse



Right angle: 90 degree angle

Acute angle: an angle less then 90 degrees

Obtuse angle: an angle larger than 90 degree but less than 180 degrees

Reflex angle: angle from 180 to 360 degrees
   
Straight Angle: exactly 180 degrees



			Parallel lines



Parallel lines: lines that will never cross

Parallel lines symbol: <--> || <-->
                        AB      CD

Distinct lines: different lines   



Perpindicular Lines

	 Lines that form right angles at their intersection

		 <--> | <-->    
          	  AB ___ CD


Transversal 


			Naming angles



Symbol for angles: <DEB

How to name: Vertex is always the middle letter

How to represent angle degress: m<BPD = 80 degrees



			Perpindicular Bisectors



Midpoints: point exactly halfway between two other points| equidistant(same distant) from both points

Bisects: divides two points into two equal parts

Perpindicular bisector: Intersects a line segment at a 90 degree angle



			Combining Angles



If the combined angle has a ray in between those two, you can just add the degrees



			Complementary angles



Complementary angles: Angles that add up to 90 degrees


Supplementary angles: angles that add up to 180 degrees




			Coterminal Angles





Coterminal angles: angles that differ by a whole number of complete rotations



			Vertical Angles



Congruent Angles: angles that have the same measure

Vertical Angles: angles on opposite sides of intersecting lines

Vertical Angles are always congruent



			Corresponding Angles



Corresponding angles: congruent angles in matching positions along a transversal



			Perimeter 



Add all the numbers together


			Pythagoream Theorem



Finds a missing side length 

a^2+b^2 = c^2

c is always the diagonal line of a right triangle

		Types of Triangles



Scalene: no sides have the same length

Isosceles: two or three sides have the same length

Equilateral: all three sides have the same length



		Distance between two points


 
      ______________
d = \|(x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2


d=sqrt(x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2



Triangle Midsegment Theorem

	Proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWGSbV8QYok

	Midsegments: the line connecting one midpoint of a side to another midpoint of another side

		1) Parallel to one of the triangle sides
		
		2) 1/2 the length of the parallel side  


Triangle proof rules(reasonings) 
	
	AAS – Angle angle side [two angles one after another are congruent and have a congruent side]  

	(difference between AAS and ASA is the order of the angles & sides) 

	ASA – Angle side angle [two congruent angles seperated by a congruent side]

	SSS – Side side side [all sides are congruent] 

	SAS –Side angle side[two congruent sides seperated by an angle] 

	HL -
